sc_sdram_burst
==============

The SDRAM module is designed for 16 bit read and write access of arbitrary length at up to 50MHz clock rates.
The component includes 2 modules - 
  * module_sdram - functions as a standalone component for reading and writing to one or more SDRAMs,
  * module_sdram_memory_mapper - functions as a wrapper to the module_sdram as a memory address abstraction layer.
Example applications have been provided with the component
 - app_sdram_demo - demonstrates how the module is used to accesses memory on the SDRAM,
 - app_sdram_benchmark -  benchmarks the performance of the module,
 - app_sdram_regress - serves as a software regression to aid implementing new SDRAM interfaces and verifying current setups.
