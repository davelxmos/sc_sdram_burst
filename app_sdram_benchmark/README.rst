SDRAM Benchmark Application
===========================

:scope: Example
:description: Benchmarks the performance of the module.
:keywords: Memory,SDRAM
:boards: XA-SK-SDRAM

This application produces performance information for the SDRAM server. It 
reports both bandwidth and latency of the I/O of the server. It does no 
correctness testing but instead tests the SDRAM server. Note, this takes a while
to run; it is meant as a test tool.
